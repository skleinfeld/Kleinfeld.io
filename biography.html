    <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
    <p class="muted">Born and raised in El Paso, TX, named after my grandfather, Saul D. Kleinfeld — a civic leader who helped shape the city’s amateur sports community.</p>
    <p>I serve as Senior Product Manager at RazorMetrics and Vice President of the Rookie Division for the NTABL, combining product thinking with league operations and player development.</p>
    <p class="muted">I’m an Eagle Scout with 25+ fifty-mile treks (AK, HI, NZ, CO). I love cooking, traveling, and life with my wife, Hannah, plus our two dogs and four cats.</p>
    <p>For me, life mirrors baseball: it’s not about perfection — it’s about showing up, learning, and staying in the game.</p>
