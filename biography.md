      <p>
        Saul B. Kleinfeld was born and raised in El Paso, Texas, named after his grandfather, 
        Saul D. Kleinfeld, a civic leader who helped shape the city’s amateur sports community. 
        That legacy continues to guide Saul’s work and passion today.
      </p>

      <p>
        He serves as Senior Product Manager at RazorMetrics, where he leads creative technology 
        solutions that simplify complex problems and improve the customer experience. His leadership 
        style is grounded in servant leadership, empowering teams to succeed through collaboration 
        and purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond his professional work, Saul is Vice President of the Rookie League for the 
        North Texas Amateur Baseball League (NTABL), where he oversees league operations, team 
        development, and player engagement. On the field, he plays for the East Dallas Expos 
        and manages Gann’s Bulls, combining his lifelong love for baseball with a commitment 
        to growing the game and its community.
      </p>

      <p>
        An Eagle Scout and avid traveler, Saul has completed more than 25 fifty-mile treks across 
        places like Alaska, Hawaii, and New Zealand. He enjoys cooking, exploring new places, and 
        spending time with his wife, Hannah, and their two dogs and four cats.
      </p>

      <p>
        For Saul, life mirrors baseball: it’s not about perfection, but about showing up, learning, 
        and always staying in the game.
